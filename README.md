# Forecasting---Liquor-Sales-Data
Analytics project on understaning the basics of time-series. In this project I have tried to create a SARIMA model to predict the Liquoar sales for the future.

Data:
The csv files contains the monthly sales data of liquor from 1992 to 2018. It has two columns:
DATE : date time column
MRTSSM4453USN : Sale of liquor in that Month.


Aim:
The aim is to analyze the data and build a Forecasting model using the data, that will be able to predict the sales of liquors in the near future.
